\section{Introduction}
Companies that are classified as critical infrastructure as for example electricity grids, power plants and their corresponding distribution systems, 
constitute a vulnerability which can be exploited to disrupt the supply of basic resources to entire countries. For this reason, laws such as the Network 
and Information Security Act (NIS-2) \cite{NIS-2:2022} of the European Union or the IT Act 2.0 \cite{IT-Gesetz_2:2021} of the German Federal Office for 
Information Security (BSI) demand a unified level of cybersecurity for these entities. 

\begin{verbatim}
-- HIER NOCH WEITER ZU IT 2.0 UND NIS-2
\end{verbatim}

As basis for communication predominantly used in substations and later on in smartgrids, the International Electrotechnical Comission (IEC) publishes 
and maintains the IEC 61850 standard \cite{IEC61850:2023}, which is used to transmit diagnostical information, measurement information or control signals 
between Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) entities and the associated substation components. The major advantage here consists of the 
object-oriented data structure specified in this standard, which enables the integration of various components developted by different vendors 
\cite[p. 5643]{Review_IEC62351:2019}.
